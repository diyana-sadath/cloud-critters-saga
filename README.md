Baadal Baba ☁️🪄
The all-knowing sky sage who sees what you cannot.

Ever stared at a cloud and confidently declared, “That’s definitely a flying elephant with sunglasses,” only to be met with judgmental stares? Fear not. Baadal Baba is here to bless your imagination with legitimacy and lore. 🧘‍♂️✨

🌩️ How It Works (aka Baadal Baba's Ritual)
Upload a photo of clouds you've spotted.

Baadal Baba gazes into it with the power of AI.

He hallucinates an imaginary creature within.

Bestows it with a name and a divine backstory.

Adds it to the Cloud Lore Wiki – the sacred scroll of silly sky beasts.

If it's truly ridiculous, it might ascend the Leaderboard of Absurdity.

🔮 The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People see things in clouds. Always have. But has anyone ever written their names down? Given them histories? Made them famous?

Nope.

🔧 The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made Baadal Baba, your cloud-seeing guru.
He turns your puffy sky blobs into mythical creatures with Malayalam names, tragic movie-style stories, and a shot at sky-fame.
