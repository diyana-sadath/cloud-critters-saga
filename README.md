# Baadal ☁︎

Have you ever looked up at a cloudy sky and told your friend "that cloud looks like a cat!", only for your friend to say that you need to get your eyes checked...
Well, we're here with Baadal to not only validate your imagination, but also give it some character ✨

Here's how it works:
1. Upload a photo of clouds that you see.
2. AI imagines what animal it sees in the clouds.
3. Gives it a name and a sweet little backstory.
4. Adds the animal to the Cloud Lore Wiki — a collection of all weird cloud creatures ever spotted.
5. Leaderboard shows the most ridiculous animals of the day/week — based on user votes or absurdity scores.

🎨 Tech Stack
Frontend: React / Next.js (with cloud-themed whimsical UI)
Backend: Supabase or Firebase (for storage + voting)
AI: Gemini (to generate name, animal, and story)
Hosting: Vercel or Netlify

📚 Cloud Lore Wiki
Every cloud animal gets a page in the great skybook of creatures.
Each entry includes:
- The original cloud photo
- The animal name
- The story
- A score 

You can browse this infinite dream zoo any time.

🏆 Leaderboard
Because nothing is more serious than the silliest animal of the day.
Top animals based on upvotes or pure absurdity make the leaderboard.

🚀 Running Locally

💡 Bonus Notes
Don’t take this app too seriously. We definitely didn’t.

But also, maybe take a second to lie on the grass and watch the clouds sometime.
They do look like they’re trying to tell us something.
