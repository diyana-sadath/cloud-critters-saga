# ✨ Baadal Baba ✨

*nee manasil kaanunnath njan maanath kaanum ;)*

☁️ What Is This?
Baadal Baba is a gloriously fun web app that brings cloud watching into the digital age.

You take a photo of the clouds.
We show you the weird animal hiding inside.
We name it.
We tell you its origin story (written by an AI that acts like a sugar-high 5-year-old).

It's a little bit AI.
A little bit nonsense.
And a whole lot of sky magic.

🧠 What It Does
☁️ Upload a photo of clouds (or use your phone camera).

🐙 AI imagines what animal it sees in the clouds.

✏️ Gives it a name like “Sir Puddlewhisk the Third”.

📖 Writes a silly backstory for the animal.

🌐 Adds the animal to the Cloud Lore Wiki — a collection of all weird cloud creatures ever spotted.

🔥 Leaderboard shows the most ridiculous animals of the day/week — based on user votes or absurdity scores.

🎨 Tech Stack
Frontend: React / Next.js (with cloud-themed whimsical UI)

Backend: Supabase or Firebase (for storage + voting)

AI: OpenAI GPT-4 Vision (to generate name, animal, and story)

Hosting: Vercel or Netlify

📚 Cloud Lore Wiki
Every cloud animal gets a page in the great skybook of creatures.
Each entry includes:

The original cloud photo

The animal name

The story

A silly score (random, AI-generated, or voted)

You can browse this infinite dream zoo any time.

🏆 Leaderboard
Because nothing is more serious than the silliest animal of the day.
Top animals based on upvotes or pure absurdity make the leaderboard.
